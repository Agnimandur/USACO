## USACO
In this repository, you will primarily find solutions for hundreds of old USACO problems, including many Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum problems. Additionally, you can find my useful Codeforces code template, including helpful suggestions on what to look out for.

## Data Structures and Algorithms
Additionally, you can find my templates for various data structures and algorithms which are commonly used in Competitive Programming in general. All of these algorithms are provided in the form of self contained classes, which can be easily integrated into your code.

## Java
Almost all of the solutions and algorithms in this repository are written in Java (except for some old Bronze problems). If you code in Java, this repo might be right for you!

## Sorted By Year
As of March 2021, the problems in this repository are now sorted by year, and then subsorted by division.

## USACO Spreadsheet!
This repo also has a USACO spreadsheet to help you keep track of your solved problems. Kind of like OI Checklist, but specifically for USACO.
